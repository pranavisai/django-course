How Django works?

URL -> Uniform Resourse Location 
This can be a page, image, video or pdf

As soon as the request from client comes to the server it is taken up and a response is sent. This is carried out by the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol).
For each page being navigated each HTTP request is sent.

Two ways to send a response:
1. To completely send a HTML (HyperText Markup Language) page everytime a request is received.
2. To send only the data while the HTML page already loads on the client end.

What is the use? -> By doing this, the server has freed up space and can have more pages data to serve different types of requests.
